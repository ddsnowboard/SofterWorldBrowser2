# SofterWorldBrowser2
The original SofterWorldBrowser is fat and slow. How fast can I make it?

================================

I was reading LowTechMagazine and I was impressed that they were able to run their whole public website on only a few Watts with a tiny SBC, and have it be incredibly fast. SofterWorldBrowser was made to be fast, and it is pretty fast to run, but the requests take forever, and the entire assemblage is just dumb and stupid. Can I do better?
